The guidlines are simple

(Please read all before doing!)

1.Before contibuting your work please seek approval of the owner (Bloodredwolf aka Ryan), if he approves he shall send you to seek approval from a different MANAGMENT member.

2.If both agree please give the contibution a understandable title and a good description. The description should include these words "i have seeked permision by Ryan and it has been granted along with"managment members name" which was assigned by Ryan".

3.If you are changing something that has already been done i and is of a significant importance (Ryan will tell you if it is or is not) then also seek approval from a member of your choice. This too should be put in the description.


The above steps should be ignored if you are given a "instant" approval from Ryan which should be put in the description as so not to be questioned.


Thank you
